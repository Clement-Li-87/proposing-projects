# Hosting Projects under the LF Deep Learning (LF DL) Foundation 
This repo contains the LF DL Project Proposal Process and Project Lifecycle. They explain the process to host new projects in the <a href="https://deeplearningfoundation.org/">LF DL Foundation</a> and provide a proposal template. Projects may apply to join the LF DL Foundation by completing and submitting the Project Contribution Proposal Template. A vote of both the <a href="https://lists.deeplearningfoundation.org/g/tac-general/wiki/Home">Technical Advisory Committee (TAC)</a> and the Governing Board is required for a project to be accepted into the LF DL Foundation. 

# Incubation Stage Requirements

To be accepted to at the Incubation stage, a project must:

<ul>
<li>Submit a completed Project Contribution Proposal to the TAC at the email address indicated in the proposal template.
<li>Present the project and the proposal to the TAC and, if requested, the Governing Board.
<li>Be deemed by the TAC and Governing Board to fall within the scope of LF DL Foundation mission, and add value to the open source AI/ML/DL ecosystem.
<li>Have an OSI-approved open source license. 
<li>Agree to transfer any relevant trademarks to The Linux Foundation or its affiliate, LF Projects, LLC, and to assist in filing for any relevant unregistered ones.  In the case of projects with established trademarks where a trademark transfer is difficult, we generally recommend the project begin operations under a new name. Note that no patent or copyright assignment is necessary in order for a project to join the Deep Learning effort.
<li>Receive the affirmative vote of the TAC and Governing Board.
</ul>

# Graduation Stage Requirements

To be accepted to the Graduation stage, a project must meet the Incubation stage requirements plus:
<ul>
<li>Have a healthy number of committers from at least two organizations*.
<li>Have achieved and maintained a <a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en">Core Infrastructure Initiative Best Practices Badge</a>.
<li>Demonstrate a substantial ongoing flow of commits and merged contributions*.
<li>Document current project owners and current and emeritus committers in OWNERS.md and COMMITTERS.md files.  A copy of the projectâ€™s charter (or other authorized governance document) shall be included or linked to in a GOVERNANCE.md or in a similar file. 
<li>Have a technical lead appointed for representation of the project to the TAC.
<li>Receive the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the TAC and the affirmative vote of the Governing Board.
</ul>

*Since these metrics can vary significantly depending on the type, scope and size of a project, the TAC has final judgment over the level of activity that is adequate to meet these criteria.
