== Kompute Project Proposal

*Name of project*: Kompute

*Requested project maturity level*: Sandbox

=== Project description

General purpose GPU compute framework for cross vendor graphics cards (AMD, Qualcomm, NVIDIA & friends). Blazing fast, mobile-enabled, asynchronous and optimized for advanced GPU data processing usecases. 

Typical usecases are:

* General Purpose GPU Computing
* Develop GPU accelerated kernels for advanced data processing use-cases
* Extend scientific applications to enable for mobile and cross vendor GPU support

Kompute Mission:

* Further the GPGPU ecosystem for scientific and industry applications through cross-vendor graphics card tooling and capabilities (across AMD, Qualcomm, NVIDIA & Friends)
* Foster ecosystem of parallel & distributed frameworks, standards and applications that enables for efficient and robust GPGPU
* Standardisation of underlying cross-vendor GPGPU computing across advanced data processing frameworks
* Enable high performance processing for GPU accelerated mobile and edge processing use-cases


=== Statement on alignment with LF AIâ€™s mission

Kompute Project will:

* Provide interoperability for applications to introduce GPGPU through  higher level C++, Python, or other
* Enable edge processing capabilities through current capabilities in Android, IOS, Raspberry Pi, etc
* Build ecosystem of higher level tools for specialised functionality
* Serve as an anchor to the Khronos Group as LFAI has core DL/ML application
