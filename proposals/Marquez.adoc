== Marquez Project Proposal

*Name of the project*: Marquez

*Requested maturity level*: Incubation

*Description*
Marquez is an open source metadata service for the collection, aggregation, and visualization of a data ecosystem’s metadata. It maintains the provenance of how datasets are consumed and produced, provides global visibility into job runtime and frequency of dataset access, centralization of dataset lifecycle management, and much more. 

*Alignment with LF AI’s mission*: Machine Learning requires better data pipelines. Marquez gives visibility into data quality, enables reproducibility, facilitates  operations and build accountability and trust.
