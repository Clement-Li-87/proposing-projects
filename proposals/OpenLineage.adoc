== OpenLineage Project Proposal

*Name of project*: OpenLineage

*Requested project maturity level*: Sandbox

*Description*:

The OpenLineage project proposes an open standard and API for lineage collection
that data processing engines can implement to publish at run time details of the
data sources that it is reading, the types of processing it is performing and the destination of the results.

More information in GitHub:
https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage

*Statement on alignment with LF AIâ€™s mission*:
 
Lineage is a critical component in governing AI and Data projects.

*Possible collaboration opportunities with current LF AI hosted projects*: (https://lfai.foundation/projects/)

This standard is being developed in collaboration between the Marquez and Egeria projects.
Additionally the Amundsen project is a candidate for implementing ingestion of OpenLineage events.
The following project are candidates to emit OpenLineage metadata: Acumos, AI Explainability/Fairness 360, Angel ML, Feast, ForestFlow, Horovod, Ludwig, Onnx, Pyro
