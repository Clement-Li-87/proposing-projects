== Amundsen Project Proposal


*Name of project*: Amundsen

*Requested project maturity level*: Incubation

*Project description*
Amundsen is open-sourced by Lyft in 2019. It is a metadata driven application for improving the productivity of data analysts,
data scientists and engineers when interacting with data.
It does that by indexing data resources (tables, dashboards, streams, etc.)
and powering a page-rank style search based on usage patterns (e.g. highly queried tables show up earlier than less queried tables).

*Statement on alignment with LF AIâ€™s mission*:
Amundsen collects and aggregates various system metadata and provides visibility into data entities context. This provides trust in data and powers users to make data-driven decisions.

Have you identified possible collaboration opportunities with current LF AI hosted projects (https://lfai.foundation/projects/)?
