== Project Proposal Template

* Name of project:

Artigraph

Sandbox

* Project description (what it does, why it is valuable, origin and history, ongoing development).

Artigraph is a tool to improve the authorship, management, and quality of data. It emphasizes that the core deliverable of a data pipeline or workflow is the data, not the tasks.

The project was started at Replica, Inc and open sourced in January 2022.

Artigraph aims to shift tooling focus towards managing the entire data lifecycle (lineage, metadata, schema, storage formats and systems, etc), which overlaps with a number of LF AI & Data goals and projects.

Yes:

- AI Explainability 360 / AI Fairness 360: explain and assess bias in model outputs
