== Elastic Deep Learning (EDL) Proposal

*a.	name of project or proposed name of project (must be unique within Deep Learning):*

EDL

*b.	requested project maturity level (Graudation or Incubation stage):*

Incubation stage

*c.	project description (what it does, why it is valuable, origin and history):*

EDL is an Elastic Deep Learning framework designed to help Deep Learning Cloud Service providers to build cluster cloud services using different deep learning frameworks PaddlePaddle, Tensorflow, etc.). EDL includes a Kubernetes controller, PaddlePaddle auto-scaler, which changes the number of processes of distributed jobs to the idle hardware resource in the cluster, and a new fault-tolerable architecture.

*d.	statement on alignment with Deep Learning’s mission:*

EDL falls within the mission of Deep Learning. The project helps cloud service providers build cluster cloud services using various deep learning frameworks.

*e. Project’s license:* Apache-2.0 

*f. Source control (GitHub, etc.):* https://github.com/paddlepaddle/edl

*g. External dependencies (including licenses of those dependencies):*

  * Kubernetes (Apache-2.0)
  * Go                      

*h. Initial committers (how long working on project):*

  * Wangyi: Half a year, project founder
  * Wuyi: Half a year, main contributor

*i. RACI if applicable / exists:* Not applicable

*j. Infrastructure requests (CI / cluster requirements):* None

*k. Mailing lists currently in use:* None 

*l. Issue tracker (GitHub by default):* GitHub issue tracker

*m. Website:* https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/edl/

*n. Release methodology and mechanics:* Released on GitHub
