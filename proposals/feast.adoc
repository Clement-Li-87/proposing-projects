== Feast Project Proposal

*Name of project*: Feast

*Requested project maturity level*: Incubation

*Project description*

Feast is an open source feature store for machine learning. It was developed as a collaboration between Gojek and Google in 2018.

Feast aims to:

* Provide scalable and performant access to feature data for ML models during training or serving.
* Provide a consistent view of features for both training and serving.
* Enable re-use of features through discovery, documentation, and metadata tracking.
* Ensures model performance by tracking, validating, and monitoring features in production.

*Statement on alignment with LF AIâ€™s mission*:

Many of the largest challenges with operational machine learning center around data. These challenges are both technical and operational. Feast provides a means for defining, managing, storing, and serving features to production ML systems. Feast allows data scientists and engineers to collaborate through shared definitions of features, allowing teams to get new features into production faster and more reliably.
