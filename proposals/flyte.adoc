== Flyte Project Proposal

*Name of project*: Flyte 

*Requested project maturity level*: Incubation 

*Project description* (what it does, why it is valuable, origin and history, ongoing development).
Flyte is a production-grade, declarative, structured and highly scalable cloud-native workflow
orchestration platform. It allows users to describe their ML/Data pipelines
using Python, Java or (in the future other languages) and Flyte manages the
data flow, parallelization, scaling and orchestration of these pipelines. Flyte
builds on top of Docker containers and kubernetes.

The feature-set and extensibility of Flyte makes it extremely useful for
Machine Learning pipelines - like Feature Engineering, Adhoc and periodic Model
Training, Model evaluation, ML monitoring, ETL and general data processing. Flyte has extensions for
Pandas, Tensorflow, Pytorch, Spark and integrates with Hosted cloud services
like AWS Sagemaker, Athena etc.

Flyte was built at Lyft and is used in production at Lyft, Level-5 (autonomous), Spotify,
Freenome and other companies.

*Statement on alignment with LF AIâ€™s mission*. 
Flyte is built to streamline - Data Scientists, ML Engineers journey from idea
to production. Its mission is to break down silos between infrastructure,
data, ML and product teams. Flyte can be a backbone that can help integrate the
various technologies under LF umbrella.

*Have you identified possible collaboration opportunities with current LF AI hosted projects (https://lfai.foundation/projects/)? Please explain.*
Flyte is a natural platform for collaboration and it improves because of
collaboration. At Lyft, Flyte was already used in conjunction with horovod and
it can be easily integrated with ONNX, Ludwig, Mars, Amundsen, EDL, Feast-
feature serving, Marquez etc. It might be a great central system for many projects
to interact and enrich the users workflows.

*Project website - Do you have a web site? If no, did you reserve a domain, and would like you to have a website created?*
We have a website [https://flyte.org](https://flyte.org), we definitely want to update the content and have a proper build process around it.
