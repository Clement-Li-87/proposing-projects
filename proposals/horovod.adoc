Project description
Horovod is a distributed training framework for TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch. The goal of
Horovod is to make distributed Deep Learning fast and easy to use.
Alignment with Deep Learning Foundation mission
Horovod provides the community of data scientists, researchers and AI developers with tooling
to scale their deep learning models with ease and high performance.
Possible integrations with existing LF DL projects:
● https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/edl - schedule Horovod jobs in Kubernetes, add elastic
support.

Infrastructure requests
In order to facilitate external development, we need to make it easy for anyone to run integration
tests.
Currently, we’re using Travis CI for integration tests which provides CPU tests only. There has
been a number of issues where only GPU components failed, while CPU tests were passing.
This forces developers to run integration tests on GPU boxes manually.
We’d like to make use of LF continuous integration environment and request a GPU support.
Since AWS is planning to be involved in the project, we should discuss the potential of running
the integration tests on AWS GPUs.
Current mailing lists
None, we will request LF to create lists for users, developers, and TSC.

Release methodology & mechanics
The release is performed when committers pass the vote to do so. The release is performed by
the Release Manager (Alex Sergeev).
The release procedure is as follows:
1. Verify that Travis CI tests are passing.
2. Run current master tests on GPU servers.
3. Run ImageNet training convergence tests for Keras and PyTorch.
4. Run synthetic performance tests for TensorFlow and PyTorch.
5. Make PR to bump Horovod Python package version.
6. Publish Horovod package to PyPI.
7. Publish docker image to DockerHub.
Social media accounts
None
Existing sponsorship
Uber, Amazon, NVIDIA, IBM, and Intel have provided developer resources to improve Horovod.
