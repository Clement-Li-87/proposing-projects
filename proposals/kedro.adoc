## Kedro Project Proposal

*Name of the project*: Kedro

*Requested maturity level*: Incubation

*Description*: Kedro is an open-source Python framework for creating reproducible, maintainable and modular data science code. It borrows concepts from software engineering best-practice and applies them to machine-learning code; applied concepts include modularity, separation of concerns and versioning.

*Alignment with LF AI & Dataâ€™s mission*: Kedro provides a framework for authoring machine learning code underpinned by software engineering best practice which in turn makes code easier to deploy into production systems. Kedro is a framework that supports LF AI & Data's objectives in MLOPs as well as Machine Learning Engineering.
