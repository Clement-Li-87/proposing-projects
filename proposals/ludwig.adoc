== Project Proposal Template


* Name of project: Ludwig

* Requested project maturity level: Incubation

* Project description (what it does, why it is valuable, origin and history, ongoing development).

Ludwig is a toolbox built on top of TensorFlow that allows to train and test deep learning models without the need to write code.

All you need to provide is your data, a list of fields to use as inputs, and a list of fields to use as outputs, Ludwig will do the rest. Simple commands can be used to train models both locally and in a distributed way, and to use them to predict on new data.

A programmatic API is also available in order to use Ludwig from your python code. A suite of visualization tools allows you to analyze models' training and test performance and to compare them.

Ludwig is built with extensibility principles in mind and is based on data type abstractions, making it easy to add support for new data types as well as new model architectures.

It can be used by practitioners to quickly train and test deep learning models as well as by researchers to obtain strong baselines to compare against and have an experimentation setting that ensures comparability by performing standard data preprocessing and visualization.

Ludwig provides a set of model architectures that can be combined together to create an end-to-end model for a given use case. As an analogy, if deep learning libraries provide the building blocks to make your building, Ludwig provides the buildings to make your city, and you can chose among the available buildings or add your own building to the set of available ones.

Ludwig was developed at Uber AI Labs over the course of two years by Piero Molino before its open source release in February 2019, with the Help of Yaroslav Dudin and Sai Sumanth Miryala. It was initially meant to be a tool for simplifying the comparison of NLP models on a specific task, but adding more tasks and data types support made it a generic tool that started being used by several teams at the company.
As Ludwig leverages many open source libraries, it was released itself as open source to give back to the community.

The ongoing development of new features, which include eager execution, model zoo, generic data pipelines and seamless hyperparameter optimization aim at making Ludwig the default choice for open source deep learning based AutoML. 

* Statement on alignment with LF AIâ€™s mission: Deep Learning is still perceived as a difficult technology to grasp and use. Ludwig gives the possibility for a much broader audience of less experienced engineers and data scientists to use those models in their project by providing easy-to-use tools and APIs for Deep Learning, with the goal of democratizing it.
