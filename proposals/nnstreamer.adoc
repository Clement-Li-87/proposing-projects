== NNStreamer Project Proposal


*Name of the project*: NNStreamer

*Requested maturity level*: Incubation stage

*Description*:
NNStreamer is a set of https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org[GStreamer] plugins that allow various neural network models and their frameworks along with tensor-related operations in GStreamer pipelines.
NNStreamer also provides GStreamer plugins to attach other frameworks (ROS, Tizen Sensor F/W, Linux IIO, and so on) to GStreamer pipelines, which were generally not considered in conventional GStreamer applications, but are useful for neural network applications in general.


NNStreamer promotes easier and efficient development of on-device AI systems by allowing to describe general systems with various input, outputs, processors, and neural networks easily with the pipe-and-filter architecture. It provides easy-to-use APIs with corresponding SDKs as well: C-APIs (all platforms), Tizen.NET (C#), and Android (Java) along with a wide range of nerual network frameworks and software platforms (Ubuntu, macOS, OpenEmbedded).
NNStreamer has started as an open source project since 2018 and is under active developoment with Tizen project and a wide range of consumer electronic devices.

*Statement on alignment with LF AIâ€™s mission:* Machine Learning applications often process online stream input data in real-time, which may include multiple pre/post-processors, neural networks, input and output nodes, and complex data paths. Such a complex system can be easily represented and efficiently executed as a stream pipeline by NNStreamer along with conventional stream pipeline libraries (GStreamer and its plugins).


*Have you identified possible collaboration opportunities with current LF AI hosted projects (https://lfai.foundation/projects/)? Please explain.*:

 * Acumos AI: import deployed AI models to NNStreamer pipelines or let models be updated via ACumos.
 * Marquez: import data from Marquez pipelines as inputs of NNStreamer pipelines for neural network training.
 * ONNX: NNStreamer APIs may need to support ONNX model files for ONNX-compliant frameworks.
 * Sparklyr: import data from Sparklyr streams to NNStreamer pipelines.
