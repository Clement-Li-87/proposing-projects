OpenDS4All Project Proposal
Name of project: OpenDS4All
Requested project maturity level: Incubation
Project description
OpenDS4All is a project created to accelerate the creation of data science curricula at academic institutions. While a great deal of online material is available for data science, including online courses, we recognize that the best way for many students to learn (and for many institutions to deliver) content is through a combination of lectures, recitation or flipped classroom activities, and hands-on assignments. OpenDS4All attempts to fill this important niche. Our goal is to provide recommendations, slide sets, sample Jupyter notebooks, and other materials for creating, customizing, and delivering data science and data engineering education.  The project hosts educational modules that may be used as building blocks for a data science curriculum.
Statement on alignment with LF AI’s mission:
Many of the largest challenges with operational machine learning center around data. These challenges are both technical and education (talent). OpenDS4All addressed the education challenge.
