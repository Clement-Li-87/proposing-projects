== Pyro Project Proposal

*Name of the project*: Pyro

*Requested maturity level*: Incubation

*Description*

Pyro is a Deep Probabilistic Programming Language built on the PyTorch deep learning framework. Pyro provides a language for probabilistic modeling and inference, together with well-tested scalable implementations of inference algorithms including Stochastic Variational Inference and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.

Pyro was developed at Uber AI Labs as a platform for research in deep Bayesian models, including Bayesian Neural Nets and amortized Bayesian inference. Pyro has been used for time series forecasting, sensor fusion, and is widely used by AI researchers.
